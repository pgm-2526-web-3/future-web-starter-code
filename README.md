# Future web - Starter Code

A collection of small starter projects and exercises for web development practice. Each folder contains a self-contained starter app intended for hands-on exercises and learning.

## Getting started

- Navigate into any exercise folder.
- Install deps if needed: `npm install`
- Start the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Notes

- Most projects use PicoCSS for lightweight styling.
- Each exercise typically includes a package.json and a simple dev setup; read the folder README for exercise-specific instructions.

## Structure

- `<exercise-folder>`
  - package.json
  - src/ (or public/)
    - starter-code (do not change things here as a student)
    - exercise.css (this is the file you can practice your CSS)
  - README.md (exercise details)

## Contributing

- Feel free to add new exercises or improvements. Keep examples small and focused for easy reuse in class.
