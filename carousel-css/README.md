## Structure

Exercise folder is the main folder, you can create as many pages as you want. In the `src`-folder you'll find CSS and JS.

---

Do not work in the starter-css (only teachers can change the `starter-css/exercise`) code during prep to add custom exercise CSS.

As a student you'll only work in the `exercise.css`.
